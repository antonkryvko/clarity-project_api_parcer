# Clarity-project_parcer
A parcer to get information about Ukrainian companies from [Clarity Project](https://clarity-project.info).

You need a valid API-key to use it. Mail **hello@clarity-project.info** to receive an API-key.
In case you have no API key, program will try to scrape data.

Before you start, change variables in settings.py:
* `API_KEY` (line 11),
* `INPUT_CSV` (line 8),
* `EDRPOU_COLUMN_HEADER` (line 13),
* `OUTPUT_CSV` (line 9) to your values.
